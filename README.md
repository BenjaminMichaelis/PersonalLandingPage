## To run locally

Clone to your local machine, and use the command `npm start` from the GraphSketchpad project directory to run the app in development mode.

As long as you don't have another application running this will be ready to view at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and will reload if you make edits.

To build for production run `npm run build` and it will build the app for production to the `build` folder.

Using <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">netlify</a> to deploy the app live.
